# CTF BourgPalette

A pokemon-like project game where you level up by hacking your neighbor. 

You play as a new hacker. You are not trying to capture all the pokemons but to capture all the flags! CTF is for Capture the Flag, a famous term in cybersecurity where you can try to figure out how to infiltrate and exploit on a simulation ecosystem. It's the same in CTFBourgPalette.

Built during the Secureworks Cybersecurity Literacy Challenge 2022.

| Warn when you update a level |

### Known issues
To be corrected in the next version. 

| Issues       |
